Q/write program to defines two float numbers and find if the first number is positive then find the even/odd of the two numbers, if first number is negative then find the smallest/largest of two numbers

The Solution :

let firstNum =5.2 , secNum=4.7;
  
   if(firstNum >0)
     {
       let x=Math.round(firstNum);
       let y=Math.round(secNum);
        if(x%2==0&&y%2==0)
          console.log("Both Numbers is Even");
       else 
          if(x%2==0&&y%2!=0)
            console.log("First Number is Even and Second Number is Odd")
       else
          if(x%2!=0&&y%2==0)
            console.log("First Number is Odd and Second Number is Even")
       
            else 
               console.log("Both Numbers is Odd")
     }

 else 
    if(firstNum<0)
      {
        if(firstNum>secNum)
          console.log("First Number is largest and Second Number is smallest")
        else
          if(firstNum<secNum)
              console.log("First Number is smallest and Second Number is largest")
        else 
               console.log("First Number  and Second Number is Equle")

      }
